For use in recipes, converting 'Cup' measurements and Imperial weight and volume to metric.

Version 1.0:
- Tablespoons return grams and are likely inaccurate. It would be rare for a recipe to call for dozens of either a liquid or solid in tablespoons. A tablespoon measurement should be easy to access in most situations or judge by eye if unavailable. Revisit tablespoon measurements in later versions.
- 'Cup (To Weight)' measurement will be inaccurate for most ingredients. Current baseline (125g) is equal to 1 cup plain flour.
- Currently no option to compile a recipe within the page using multiple ingredient entries. This is the main aim for the v1.1.
