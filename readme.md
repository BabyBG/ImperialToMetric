For use in recipes, converting 'Cup' measurements and Imperial weight and volume to metric. To use, make sure ImperialToMetric.html & ImperialToMetric.js are both in the same folder and open the .html file in your browser.

Version 1.0:
- Tablespoons return grams and are likely inaccurate. It would be rare for a recipe to call for dozens of either a liquid or solid in tablespoons. A tablespoon measurement should be easy to access in most situations or judge by eye if unavailable. Revisit tablespoon measurements in later versions.
- 'Cup (To Weight)' measurement will be inaccurate for most ingredients. Current baseline (125g) is equal to 1 cup plain flour.
- Currently no option to compile a recipe within the page using multiple ingredient entries. This is the main aim for the v1.1.

Version 1.1:
- 'Cup (To Weight)' measurement now reasonably accurate by ingredient.
- Feature to compile a recipe added.
- Feature to remove individual ingredients after addition to recipe added.
- Bug of mulitple 'x' delete buttons appearing (1 for every new ingredient submission on each previous ingredient entry). Cause by copy-pasting code from a list-creator project https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_todolist.asp which, while it has proved to be functional, is not clear to me what section is causing it to create extra 'x' buttons. This is the main issue to be addressed in next version.
